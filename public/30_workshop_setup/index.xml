      <description>The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges, not the root account user. Please ensure you are logged in as an IAM user, not the root account user.
This workshop was designed to run in the Oregon (us-west-2) region. Please don&amp;rsquo;t run in any other region. Future versions of this workshop will expand region availability, and this message will be removed.
-- Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.</description>

      <description>Turn Off Managed Credentials Cloud9 manages IAM credentials with temporary credentials by default. This is not currently compatible with the EKS IAM authentication, so we must disable it and rely on the IAM role we just created instead.
 Return to your workspace and click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose “Open Preferences” Select AWS Settings Turn OFF AWS managed temporary credentials Close the Preferences tab  Validate the IAM Role Use the GetCallerIdentity CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.</description>

      <description>You must have enough available VPCs, Elastic IPs, and NAT Gatewways in the region you are working in to successfully create an EKS Cluster with a managed node group of 2 nodes. You also need to have space for three S3 Buckets. If you run into a problem during the setup, it is usually associated with insufficient resources or permissions in your AWS account. You can resolve resource constraints by requesting a quota increase for your AWS account.</description>
