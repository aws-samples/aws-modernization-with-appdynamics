      <description>AD Financial on the Web Before we login to the AppDynamics console to observe the pre-modernized version of the application, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at the web interface of the application from an end users perspective.
Use the following steps to find the URL to the web site:
1 . Go to your Cloud9 console and click on the Preview option at the top
2 . Then select Preview Running Application from the drop down</description>

      <description>The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges, not the root account user. Please ensure you are logged in as an IAM user, not the root account user.
This workshop was designed to run in the Oregon (us-west-2) region. Please don&amp;rsquo;t run in any other region. Future versions of this workshop will expand region availability, and this message will be removed.
-- Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.</description>

      <description>In this section you&amp;rsquo;ll be performing the following setup and deployment steps: - Create a two node EKS cluster - Deploy the application to EKS - Deploy the server agent to EKS
Create the EKS Cluster Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the script that creates the EKS cluster using the commands below in your Cloud9 terminal:
cd /opt/appdynamics/workshopuser cat -n deployEksCluster.sh The script calls eksctl passing the cluster.yaml file to provide the cluster definition.</description>

      <description>Deploy the Cluster Agent to EKS It&amp;rsquo;s time to deploy the Cluster Agent to the EKS cluster. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the script that deploys the Cluster Agent to the cluster using the commands below in your Cloud9 terminal:
cd /opt/appdynamics/workshopuser cat -n deployClusterAgent.sh The script is performing the following actions: - Changing to the directory where the agent YAML files reside - Creates a namespace for the agent - Deploys the Cluster Agent Operator - Creates the Access Key for the agent - Deploys the Cluster Agent - Deploys the Kubernetes Metric Server</description>

      <description>Congratulations! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You have successfully completed the Advanced Observability with AppDynamics workshop! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Before we start the teardown process, please complete this survey and let us know how you liked the workshop. The feedback you provide will help us with improving this workshop along with future workshops. 
In order to prevent charges to your AWS account, we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running so you can examine the workshop a bit more, please remember to do the cleanup when you are done.</description>

      <description>Once the new architectural components were selected, Nathan, the architect we met earlier, worked with Alex and his team to take advantage of AppDynamics to once again see the real time topology of the application. Not only did this allow the teams to quickly understand all of the differences in terms of the application components, but it also enabled them to get immediate insight into how much better the overall application performance was after the modernization effort was completed.</description>

      <description>In the previous section, End User Monitoring helped us identify the 5 web pages associated with the loan approval process that showed high end user response times. We also confirmed that the high response times were directly related to the backend services supporting the browser based frontend. Now lets take a deeper dive into the backend components and services related to the loan approval process. Navigate to the APM Application Let&amp;rsquo;s start by finding the pre-modernized version of the AD Financial APM (App Performance Monitoring) application and open it to investigate the flow map.</description>

      <description>Turn Off Managed Credentials Cloud9 manages IAM credentials with temporary credentials by default. This is not currently compatible with the EKS IAM authentication, so we must disable it and rely on the IAM role we just created instead.
 Return to your workspace and click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose “Open Preferences” Select AWS Settings Turn OFF AWS managed temporary credentials Close the Preferences tab  Validate the IAM Role Use the GetCallerIdentity CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.</description>

      <description>In the previous section, Flow Maps helped us identify latency issues in the LoanServices tier, and the backend database. Now lets take a deeper dive into the business transactions related to the LoanServices tier to identify which transactions are resulting in longer response times. The Value of Business Transactions In AppDynamics a business transaction represents the data processing flow for a request, most often a user request. In real-world terms, many different components and dependencies in your application may interact to provide services to fulfill the following types of requests:</description>

      <description>You must have enough available VPCs, Elastic IPs, and NAT Gatewways in the region you are working in to successfully create an EKS Cluster with a managed node group of 2 nodes. You also need to have space for three S3 Buckets. If you run into a problem during the setup, it is usually associated with insufficient resources or permissions in your AWS account. You can resolve resource constraints by requesting a quota increase for your AWS account.</description>

      <description>What We Accomplished We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how effectively Alex and his team were able to modernize, baseline, and validate during this phase by utilizing AppDynamics.
Select Modernization Technologies and Scope Alex and his team were able to utilize AppDynamics to make a fast and accurate assessment of the required items below:
 A container orchestration solution that can automate the process of scaling, managing, updating, and removing containers. A storage solution for audit data that is secure, can scale, has redundancy, and supports high ingestion rates.</description>

      <description>In the previous section, the business transactions view helped us easily isolate the 5 problematic business transactions for the loan approval process. We identified that significant time was spent in one of the JDBC calls to the database. Let&amp;rsquo;s now take a deeper look to isolate the specific database queries that are degarding the perfomance of the loan application process. DB Visibility from APM Agents With AppDynamics APM agents, not only did we see database calls on the Flow Maps and in the Transaction Snapshots, but we also get a summary of the calls the application made to each database containing valuable KPIs.</description>

      <description>What We Accomplished Let&amp;rsquo;s recap how Nathan and his team mobilized at speed and gathered the critcal data needed during this phase by utilizing AppDynamics.
Understanding the Current Application Nathan and his team were able to utilize AppDynamics to make a fast and accurate assessment of the required items below:
 Differentiate issues in the web UI versus the backend services Inventory of all application components and the hosts they run on Inventory of all dependencies across service APIs Inventory of all dependencies to backends and third-party systems  Understanding Key Business Transactions Nathan was able to quickly understand what the key business transactions were in the application and the components they map to so he could prioritize them for refactoring during the modernization effort.</description>
