## What is Business iQ?

Business iQ is an industry first that translates code-level monitoring into immediate, clear and actionable insights, by correlating application performance, user experience and business outcomes. From the end user frontend to the application backend, AppDynamics is the premier platform, unifying full stack performance monitoring for <a href="http://www.appdynamics.com/product/business-iq/business-it-alignment/" target="_blank">**business and IT**</a> departments.


#### Measure how your application performance impacts Business Health

Business Health dashboards help you understand how application performance impacts your customers and business. Stream and surface contextual insights that show you how performance impacts key business KPIs. Business iQ provides a unified and correlated view of business performance, technology performance and user experience.

#### Monitor and get alerts on the most business-critical paths within your application

User Journey dashboards identify critical steps users take with specific conversion events or other milestones in the customer journey.  Find out where and when users abandon your application to identify latency or other potential performance challenges.


## How Does it Work?

Application Analytics powers Business iQ, a powerful component in AppDynamics. Integration of all of AppDynamics performance engines results in a dynamic, accessible set of data for every business transaction. Business iQ extracts the data, generates baselines and dashboards, and provides perspectives beyond traditional APM by enabling real-time analysis of business performance correlated with your application performance.

You can use Application Analytics with the APM, Browser RUM, Mobile RUM, and Browser Synthetic Monitoring product modules for:
