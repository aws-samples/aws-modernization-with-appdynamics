## What We Accomplished

Let's recap how Nathan and his team mobilized at speed and gathered the critcal data needed during this phase by utilizing AppDynamics. 

#### Understanding the Current Application

Nathan and his team were able to utilize AppDynamics to make a fast and accurate assessment of the required items below:

1.  Differentiate issues in the web UI versus the backend services
2.	Inventory of all application components and the hosts they run on
3.	Inventory of all dependencies across service APIs
4.	Inventory of all dependencies to backends and third-party systems


#### Understanding Key Business Transactions

Nathan was able to quickly understand what the key business transactions were in the application and the components they map to so he could prioritize them for refactoring during the modernization effort.  Utilizing AppDynamics, his team got answers to all the following key considerations:

1.	What were the key business transactions associated with services we want to refactor?
2.	The path those transactions take through the system with all components involved to map them out from start to finish.
3.	What the specific components were causing performance degradation of key business transactions?
4.	How would other business transactions be impacted by refactoring the key business transactions?

In the next section we'll look at how the development team scaled the application with the cloud services they utilized.
